# ðŸ§¹ Customer Segmentation â€” Data Preparation Phase


This repository contains the **data preparation workflow** for a customer segmentation project using an **online retail dataset**. This work was completed as part of my **menternship program**, with the primary goal of preparing data for unsupervised learning models such as **K-Means Clustering**.

---


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

The objective of this phase is to **clean, transform, and engineer** the dataset to make it suitable for clustering-based customer segmentation. The cleaned and structured data will later be used to identify meaningful customer groups and drive business insights.

---

## ðŸ“Š Workflow Overview

The data preparation process includes the following key steps:

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Loading the online retail dataset using `pandas`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding the structure, types, and summary statistics.
   - Identifying missing values and anomalies.

3. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removing rows with missing or irrelevant data.
   - Handling duplicates and formatting inconsistencies.
   - Standardizing data types.

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creating new meaningful features (e.g., scaling numerical values).
   - Transforming categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

5. **Data Transformation**  
   - Applying normalization/scaling using `StandardScaler` for better model performance.

6. **Data Export**  
   - Saving the cleaned and transformed dataset for use in clustering models.
